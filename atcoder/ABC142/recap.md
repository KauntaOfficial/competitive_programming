# ABC142 Recap
## A - Odds of Oddness
I didn't really learn much from this as the A problems are extremly simple. It's a good practice for comprehension
and coding speed though.

## B - Roller Coaster
You're able to chain cin with `cin >> a >> b` and take in consecutive values which is cool.

## C - Go To School
This one took me way too long to do mostly because of comprehension. I should work out the problems on paper before
jumping in as this really helped me figure out what needed to be done and write concise code.

## D - Disjoint Set of Common Divisors
You really have to write out solutions first. Time Complexity actually does matter as my valid solution TLE'd and 
I couldn't come up with an elegant solution.
